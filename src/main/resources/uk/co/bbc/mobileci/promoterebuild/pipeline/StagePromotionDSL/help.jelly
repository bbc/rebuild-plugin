<p>There are two ways in which to stage this build for promotion.</p>
<p>A badge is added to the job which when clicked will rebuild linking back to this job. See global promotedJob for more information</p>
<pre><code>
node {
 stagePromotion {
    message 'testing a release'
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the build uses semantic versioning, two badges can be added to the job and will trigger either a major or minor promotion build.</p>
<pre><code>
node {
 stagePromotion {
    majorReleaseMessage 'Promote a major build?'
    minorReleaseMessage 'Promote a minor build?'
 }
}
</code></pre>
</div>
